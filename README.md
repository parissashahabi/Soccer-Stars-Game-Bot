# Soccer Stars Game Bot

This project aims to develop a bot capable of competing against human players in the game Soccer Stars. The bot utilizes computer vision techniques, decision-making algorithms, and strategic gameplay to outperform opponents. The objective is to create an autonomous bot that can analyze the game state, make intelligent moves, and adapt its strategy based on opponent actions.

## Features

- Computer vision: Analyze the game screen using computer vision techniques to extract player positions, ball location, and goal positions.
- Decision-making algorithms: Implement algorithms to evaluate game states, calculate optimal moves, and make strategic decisions.
- Strategic gameplay: Develop a sophisticated strategy that incorporates offensive and defensive tactics for effective gameplay.
- Learning and adaptation: Enhance the bot's performance over time through learning mechanisms that adapt strategies based on feedback and experience.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- PyAutoGUI
